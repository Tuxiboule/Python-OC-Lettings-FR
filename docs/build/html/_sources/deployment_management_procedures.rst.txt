Deployment Management Procedures
================================

This document outlines the deployment procedures for configuring CircleCI and Render to automatically build and deploy Docker images to Docker Hub and Render, respectively.

1. Configuring CircleCI for Docker Image Builds
-----------------------------------------------
CircleCI can be configured to automatically build Docker images upon each commit to your repository. Follow these steps to set up CircleCI for Docker image builds:

   a. Create a `.circleci/config.yml` file in your repository.
   b. Configure the `config.yml` file to define the build process, including steps to build and push Docker images to Docker Hub.
   c. Configure environment variables in the CircleCI dashboard to securely store Docker Hub credentials.
   d. Add, commit, and push the `.circleci/config.yml` file to your repository.

2. Setting up Render for Automatic Deployments
----------------------------------------------
Render can be configured to automatically deploy Docker images from Docker Hub to your Render services. Follow these steps to set up Render for automatic deployments:

   a. Log in to your Render account and navigate to the dashboard.
   b. Create a new service or select an existing service that you want to deploy.
   c. Configure the service to use a Dockerfile from Docker Hub as the deployment source.
   d. Specify the Docker image name and tag to deploy (e.g., `<your-dockerhub-username>/<your-image>:latest`).
   e. Enable automatic deployments so that Render automatically pulls the latest image from Docker Hub and deploys it to the service upon each commit.

3. Testing the Deployment Pipeline
-----------------------------------
Once CircleCI and Render are configured, push a commit to your repository to trigger the deployment pipeline. CircleCI will build the Docker image, push it to Docker Hub, and then Render will automatically deploy the updated image to your service.

4. Monitoring and Troubleshooting
----------------------------------
Monitor the deployment pipeline in CircleCI and Render dashboards for any errors or failures. Review logs and notifications to identify and troubleshoot any issues that may arise during the deployment process.

By following these procedures, you can automate the deployment of Docker images from Docker Hub to Render, ensuring seamless and efficient deployment workflows for your application.
